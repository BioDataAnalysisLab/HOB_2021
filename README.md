## Hands-on Biostatistics Workshop: Analysis of non-parametric data in R

### Online workshop, July 15-16, 2021, Organized at University of Tirana, Department of Biology 


In statistics, nonparametric tests serve as an alternative to parametric tests such as T-test or ANOVA that do not require a distribution to meet the required assumptions to be analyzed.
In order to achieve the correct results from the statistical analysis, we should know the situations in which the application of nonparametric tests is appropriate. 
The aim of this workshop is to provide theoretical and practical guidance on the analysis of non-parametric data in R. The workshop will cover several nonparametric tests 
such as Wicoxon signed rank test, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman correlation with applications in R.
